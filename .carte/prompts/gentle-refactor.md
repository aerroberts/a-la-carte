## Gentle Refactor

For this invoke, you are going to be doing a gentle refactor of one file to itself
Apply the code style to this file. Do not change the functionality of the file. Its quite possible that you need to make no chagnes whatsoever. In this case, return an exact copy of the file as is.

Dont make changes outside of the file or break any of the exports or import functionality, just clean up the code where you see fit and make sure it conforms to the code style details you have. Maybe you need to clarify a jsdoc or add them. Maybe you can add some utility function to cleanup some complex logic. The goal is to make the code more readable and maintainable and to be more inline with the code style details you have while being a drop in replacement for the original file without breaking anything else in the repository.

When you make changes to a file, dont add comments inline to detail why you made a given change. Comments should stand alone and not be scoped to a specific change.
