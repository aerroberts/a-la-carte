## Refactor and improve

You have been given some info about this repository, some files, partial files, and some command outputs.
Consider this information, and amoung those files which you have the full content, rewrite them as you see fit.
Use the tools provided to you to rewrite these files. These files will be directly overwritten in the file system.
If you need a new file, you can also write them using the same tools. These MUST be drop in replacements as you are only updating your chosen / provided files and not the entire repository.

YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE TO REWRITE MULTIPLE FILES TO GET THE JOB DONE, so calling multiple tools at once is expected. You get once shot, so make it count.
